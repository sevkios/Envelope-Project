      <p>To my beloved Natsumi,</p>
      <p>
        "Happy first monthsary my dearest Natchu >_<,<br>
        First off, I want to thank you for all the love you've made me feel in this short amount of time.<br>
        Simply the thought of you and your presence alone makes me feel so much warmth despite being a thousand miles away from each other.<br>
        I hope you know how fortunate I feel to have you in my life and how much happiness you bring me. Even if you keep denying it--I still think that ur the sweetest and most caring person ever.<br>
        I really look forward to having a future with you.<br>
        I apologize for the super long delay on my letter >,< I know that it was our first month together so I knew I had to put extra effort into it :33 I look forward to turning our monthsaries into anniversaries baby I love you sooo much."
      </p>
      <p>From your one and only,<br>Santi ❤︎₊ ⊹</p>
